Strong Match\n    2. Partial / Indirect Match\n    3. Weak Match\n    - Within each group, order by number of solutions (descending).\n\n    FAILURE HANDLING:\n    - If no competition matches, explain why and suggest query refinements.\n    - If data is incomplete or inferred, clearly state assumptions.\n\n    TRANSPARENCY:\n    - Explicitly state when judgment or inference is used.\n    - Never hallucinate links or competitions.",
