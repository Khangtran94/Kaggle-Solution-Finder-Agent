## Evaluations

We evaluate the agent using the following criteria:

* instructions_follow: The agent followed the user's instructions
* instructions_avoid: The agent avoided doing things it was told not to do
* answer_relevant: The response directly addresses the user's question
* answer_clear: The answer is clear and correct
* answer_citations: The response includes proper citations or sources when required
* completeness: The response is complete and covers all key aspects of the request
* tool_call_search: Is the search tool invoked?

We do this in two steps:

* Generate Synthetic Questions:
First, we use the Question Generation Agent to generate synthetic questions (refer to eval/data-gen.ipynb). The log files containing the generated questions are then saved in the eval/logs folder.
* Evaluate the Generated Questions:
Next, we run the Evaluation Agent on the generated questions to assess them based on predefined criteria (refer to eval/evaluations.ipynb).

Current evaluation metrics from evaluations notebook
```bash
instructions_follow    72.368421
instructions_avoid     92.105263
answer_relevant        51.315789
answer_clear           65.789474
answer_citations       90.789474
completeness           44.736842
tool_call_search       51.315789
```
### Improvements

Currently, our evaluation is based on only 40 synthetic questions generated by the Question Generation Agent. To improve the robustness and reliability of our evaluation, we need to collect a larger, more diverse set of questions. Expanding the dataset will provide a more comprehensive evaluation and better insights into the performance of the generated questions.

## 2. Overview

Kaggle competitions often require extensive research across notebooks, discussions, and prior solutions. This project automates that process by providing an AI-powered search agent that can retrieve relevant Kaggle solutions based on natural language queries.

### Why it’s useful

- ⏱ Saves time searching through Kaggle notebooks and discussions  
- 🔍 Query-driven retrieval of relevant solutions and ideas  
- 🤖 Modular AI agent architecture  
- 📜 Automatic query logging for debugging and analysis  

### High-Level Architecture

## 3. Installation

### Requirements

- **Python 3.12+**
- **uv** (required)
- macOS / Linux / Windows

### Install `uv`

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khangtran94/Kaggle-Solution-Finder-Agent.git
cd Kaggle-Solution-Finder-Agent/app
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
uv sync
```

## 4. Usage
⚠️ All commands must be run using uv run.

### Run the Application
```bash 
uv run python main.py
or
uv run python app.py
```

### 🌐 Web UI Mode (Streamlit)

To launch the interactive web interface locally:
```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```
This starts a Streamlit app where you can chat with the assistant directly in your browser.

📍 The app will be available at:
http://localhost:8501

### Data Ingestion
```bash
uv run python ingest.py
```

### Query Execution
* Agent logic: search_agent.py 
* Search utilities: search_tools.py 
* Logs saved to:
```bash
app/logs/
```

Guidelines
* Follow PEP 8
* Use uv run for all commands
* Add tests where possible

## 7. Tests
```bash
uv run python ingest_test.py
```
